## Rundown
#### A cost of living estimation tool

This is a little side project that I started because I wanted a quick way to assess how introducing monetary changes to my lifestyle would positively or negatively impact my finances. Personal finance apps like Mint are good for budgeting, but don't do much to help me answer questions like "_can I afford to add X expense to my life?_" or "_what will it take for me to afford the cost of my desired lifestyle?_" or in-general experiment with hypothetical changes to my personal finances in a visual way. So here I am making my own. I originally named it OverUnder as a little inside joke to myself on betting on the odds of me saving a certain amount of money within a certain amount of time without any hiccups, but I've since decided to name it to Rundown since I'm the only person in on my own joke.

Rundown is a client-side React app which uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and components, as well as the [Neumorphism UI](https://themesberg.com/product/ui-kit/neumorphism-ui-kit-bootstrap) Bootstrap theme from Themesberg with _slight_ tweaks. All data is saved in localstorage.

**To-Do:**
- [ ] Add dark mode
- [x] Come up with a better name than "OverUnder"
- [ ] Improve mobile experience
- [ ] Design a logo
- [ ] Migrate UI from Bootstrap to Chakra
