## Rundown
#### A cost of living estimation tool

This is a little side project that I started because I wanted a quick way to assess how introducing monetary changes to my lifestyle would positively or negatively impact my finances. Personal finance apps like Mint are good for budgeting, but don't do much to help me answer questions like "_can I afford to add X expense to my life?_" or "_what will it take for me to afford the cost of my desired lifestyle?_" or in-general experiment with hypothetical changes to my personal finances in a visual way. So here I am making my own.

OverUnder is a client-side React app which uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and components, as well as the [Neumorphism UI](https://themesberg.com/product/ui-kit/neumorphism-ui-kit-bootstrap) Bootstrap theme from Themesberg with _slight_ tweaks. All data is saved in localstorage.

**To-Do:**
- [ ] Add dark mode
- [ ] Come up with a better name than "OverUnder" (current name implies something to do with gambling and was just meant to be an internal name anyway)
- [ ] Improve mobile experience
- [ ] Design a logo
- [ ] Migrate UI from Bootstrap to Chakra
